            <h1 class="margin text-center">Copycat Website</h1>
            <p class="tab">My teacher assigned a project about recreating certain websites, or your own. The selection included websites like Pupilpath, Pencil, and DeltaMath. I felt that DeltaMath would be interesting to create, since it looked pretty simple, and I was interested in creating a button, the sign in box, and the links on the site. The links magically change color when you hover over them, so that part was especially fun to recreate.</p>
            <p class="tab">A challenging part of this project was figuring out the sign in box. I got it to work by making forms and looking up how to make a button in CSS, as well as getting some assistance from my coding friend.</p>
            <p class="tab"> If you compare my website to the real DeltaMath site, you'll find a few differences... For one, my sign-in box is not as polished as the real site! It still would have the same functionality if I didn't have dead links, though. The font is a bit off, and also you can see that the top column is thicker than the original. Next time, I want to make my site responsive to screen sizes, and figure out some padding to make the sign in box look more realistic. 
             <p class="tab"> Other than that, I'm quite proud of the progress I've made; I learned a lot about what goes into a website, and am fairly confident that I could recreate another website if I had more time!</p>
