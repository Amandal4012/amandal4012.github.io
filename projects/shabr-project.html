            <h1 class="margin text-center">Shabr Project</h1>
            <p class="tab">For this project, I had to create a website about a made-up hot air balloon company. The text was pre-made, so all I had to do was style it! I made a very minimal design, with pops of color for my initial plan. However, this took on a different take as I worked on my project, which you will see soon!</p>
            
            <p class="tab">This project taught me a lot of things. I learned more about how to self-learn, with w3schools and Youtube videos helping to clarify my knowledge whenever I got stuck on positioning, media queries, and importing fonts. 
            
            <p class="tab">Additionally, I got to understand how to problem solve. For example, I needed to learn how to rotate text, but when I followed w3schools example, it didn't move my text at all. I figured out that I styled all <code>'p'</code> elements to be set to the center. To fix this, I changed the styled <code>'p'</code> elements to <code>'h6'</code> instead. Then I applied the rotation with <code>'transform: rotate(270deg)' </code>. </p>
            
            <p class="tab"> While this was a confusing and frustrating process to find the error keeping my sub titles from rotating, once I finished, I had a kind of euphoric feeling, and this inspired me to continue looking in my <code>'style.css'</code> file and problem solving further. I take that as a victory! </p>
            
            <p class="tab"> Looking back on my final stages of this project, I think I'm pretty satisfied with how responsive and stylized I've made it. However, if I could tweak or improve from this, I would definitely add the rainbow streaks, and the square links box I loved from my initial plan. This process was held back because I could not figure out how to put them next to the initial rectangular logo, and then make the boxes move as one (so they were responsive). I would have to learn media queries and bootstrap grid components more thoroughly to make this happen.</p>
            <p class="tab">Yet, I also can appreciate my snug <code>'nav'</code> links, and the minimalistic, modern appeal my website has taken on. I hope you can find a similar delight in both the designs I have made. </p>
